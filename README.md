## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the landing page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

## Key Points:
- Use a Responsive Framework:
  Consider using a responsive front-end framework like Bootstrap. These frameworks provide pre-built responsive components and grid systems that make it easier 
  to create a responsive design.
- Navigation Design:
  Create a responsive navigation menu. Use techniques like a hamburger menu for mobile devices and a full menu for larger screens.

- Mobile-First Design:
  Start designing for the smallest screen first and then progressively enhance the design for larger screens. This approach ensures that the core content and functionality are accessible on 
  mobile devices.
- Flexible Grid Layouts:
  Use CSS Flexbox for layout. These CSS modules allow for flexible and adaptive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes.
- Media Queries:
  Use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size or device characteristics. This helps in creating breakpoints for different screen sizes.
- Accessibility:
  Ensure that your landing page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, proper ARIA roles, and ensure that your page can be navigated using a 
  keyboard.
